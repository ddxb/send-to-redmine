==========================================

This extension lets you immediately create an issue with a link to the current page attached to the body.
This is incredibly useful to quickly create issues for a web app in development. Currently, the extension
has only been developed for Chrome but a Firefox plugin is coming soon! 
 
Redmine 1.3+ compatible.
